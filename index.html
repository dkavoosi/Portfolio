        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Dorsa Kavoosi, an architect and engineer with a passion for innovative and functional design. I earned my Master's degree in Architecture from Ghent University, where I developed a strong foundation in both technical precision and creative problem-solving.</p>
        <p>This website showcases a selection of my work from my student years, reflecting my growth as a designer and my exploration of architectural concepts. Currently, I work as a freelance architect at an established firm, allowing me to expand my expertise and contribute to diverse projects.</p>
        <p>My approach to architecture is driven by a deep appreciation for aesthetics, sustainability, and user experience. I believe in creating spaces that are not only visually striking but also enhance the way people interact with their environment.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out for collaborations and inquiries!</p>

            <h3>Renewing Aalst Church</h3>
            <p>In the heart of Aalst, Belgium, an old church awaited a fresh purpose. Our architectural project aimed not just to renovate the church but to add new programs that meet the communityâ€™s needs.</p>
            <p>We focused on bringing in as much natural light as possible and incorporating greenery. A glass roof lets sunlight flood in, and shared spaces were designed to be open and welcoming.</p>

            <h3>Enhancing Malem, Ghent</h3>
            <p>The Malem neighborhood in Ghent, Belgium, faces significant flood risks due to its isolated island-like nature. Our design tackled this with strategic interventions to fortify Malem against climate challenges.</p>
            <p>Key design strategies included topography modification, river slope adjustment, depavement and greening, and improved urban connectivity.</p>

            <p>Our project integrates diverse living programs into a cohesive community, combining a kangaroo house, Airbnb rental, and wheelchair-accessible housing.</p>
            <p>Using a patio model, we designed spaces that encourage social interaction and community ownership.</p>
